# python for LLM security
Python Libraries for Security:

Familiarize yourself with popular libraries:

LLM Guard: For detecting prompt injections, harmful language, and data leakage.
Use tools like Vigil or LLM Guard to detect and mitigate such attacks
Scapy: For network packet analysis.

Cryptography: For encryption and secure data handling.

Regex: For pattern matching and input validation.
# Courses like "Red Teaming LLM Applications" provide hands-on experience in evaluating LLM security

### Recommended Learning Resources
Courses:
- Python for Cybersecurity Specialization (Coursera): Covers Python automation for cybersecurity tasks.
- Python Security Playground (AppSecEngineer): Focuses on identifying and mitigating Python application vulnerabilities.
- Red Teaming LLM Applications (DeepLearning.AI): Teaches proactive LLM vulnerability testing.

Hands-On Practice:

Experiment with tools like llm-guard, Vigil, or Docker-based sandboxes for secure execution.

Develop custom scripts to automate security tasks using Python libraries like Scapy or Requests.

Documentation & Libraries:

Explore the official documentation of tools like llm-guard, Langfuse, or other LLM security frameworks to understand their implementation.

By focusing on these skills and resources, you'll be well-prepared to secure LLM applications using Python while addressing potential vulnerabilities effectively.
